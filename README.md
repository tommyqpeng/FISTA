# FISTA
My implementation of an Fast Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm on MATLAB. Based on the implementation discussed in:

Beck, Amir, and Marc Teboulle. Fast Gradient-Based Algorithms for Constrained Total Variation Image Denoising and Deblurring Problems - IEEE Xplore Document. N.p., 11 June 2009. Web. 20 Apr. 2017.

Beck, Amir, and Marc Teboulle. "A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm for Linear Inverse Problems." SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 2.1 (2009): 183-202. Web.

Project was done during BME593 - Computational Methods for Inverse Problems. The MATLAB functions and files starting with tp as well as project_test and ISTA_test were implemented by me. The data and other files were implemented by the TAs in the class.

To initiate the FISTA algorithm on the given data set, please run project_test.

The details of the implementation, as well as discussions of the technique can be found in project_writeup.pdf.
